    <p>Description of the banana bread:</p>
    <p>This classic banana bread recipe results in a moist and tender loaf with a delightful banana flavor. The combination of all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt provides the perfect texture and helps the bread rise. The softened butter and granulated sugar create a light and fluffy crumb, while the eggs add structure and richness. The ripe mashed bananas not only lend their sweet flavor but also keep the bread moist. The addition of milk and vanilla extract enhances the overall taste and aroma. Whether enjoyed for breakfast, as a snack, or for dessert, this banana bread is a comforting treat that pairs well with a cup of coffee or tea.</p>

<h3>Ingredient List</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>4 ripe bananas, mashed</li>
    <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan and set it aside.In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. Set the dry ingredients aside.</li>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the mashed bananas, milk, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
    <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract and mix until well combined.</li>
    <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix the batter. Pour the batter into the greased loaf pan, spreading it evenly.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 60-70 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. If the top starts to brown too quickly, you can loosely cover it with aluminum foil. Once baked, remove the banana bread from the oven and allow it to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.</li>
